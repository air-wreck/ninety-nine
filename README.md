# ninety-nine

Going through the [ninety nine problems of Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems) in an attempt to familiarize myself with the language. I expect to give up somewhere in the middle, but it will be interesting to see where. I don't know why these are on Github, honestly.
